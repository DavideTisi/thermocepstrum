TODO FOR v0.3 RELEASE:
- write standard setup.py and package info files
- i/o example
- move grafici_belli to utils


TODO IN FUTURE RELEASES:
- Cepstral class (subclass of CosFilter)
- plot class
- there should be one single compute_periodogram method (either for single and multi component)
- uniform indentations of 4 spaces, etc.
- in plot functions, always return (figure, axes)
- i/o: when reading a text file, the program should save a binary file (unless otherwise stated). If it finds the binary file it does not read the text one (making it clear to the user)
