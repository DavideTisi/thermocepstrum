# Examples

In this folder you can find some examples.

* In the ```data``` folder there are the trajectories, obtained from classical NVE molecular dynamic simulations, of a silica and a molten NaCl system, that are needed to run these examples.
* In the ```command_line``` folder there is an example usage of the command line tool and an example output.
* ```example_cepstrum_doublecomp_NaCl.ipynb``` is an example of the usage of the code as a library, for a molten NaCl binary system.
* ```example_cepstrum_singlecomp_silica.ipynb``` is an example of the usage of the code as a library, for a solid amorphous silica system.
