## TODO FOR v0.2/3 RELEASE:
x write standard setup.py and package info files
- i/o example
x move grafici_belli to utils


## TODO FOR 1.0 RELEASE:
### easy stuff:
- Python 3 support
- Nice formatting
- translate all comments to English
- renew plot style
- i/o: when reading a text file, the program should save a binary file (unless otherwise stated). If it finds the binary file it does not read the text one (making it clear to the user)
- in plot functions, always return (figure, axes)

### harder stuff:
- Cepstral class (subclass of CosFilter)
- plot class
- there should be one single compute_periodogram method (either for single and multi component)
